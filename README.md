# Module 3 Challenge - Customer Banking
## _Objective_
To create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months. 

## _Challenges_
The most challenging part of this homework was keeping all of the functions and the function names straight. I found myself running into errors mostly due to having the wrong names attached to the functions.

## _Credits_
I copied lines 35 and 37 of my customer_banking.py from the atm_modular_design_solution.py found in lesson 2 activities. 

 I also asked chatGTP to help with line 29 of customer_banking.py and explain what it was doing.
    updated_cd_balance, cd_interest_earned = create_cd_account(cd_balance, cd_interest_rate, cd_months)

## _What Did I Learn?_
I learned that it is very easy to get confused jumping between py files. Early on in my attempt at the homework, if I got stuck I would jump to another part, but that led to errors and frustation. I considered the homework hint of adding my functions to one file and then separating and that proved to be easier and less consfusing. I also gained more comfortability with importing classes and creating instances
